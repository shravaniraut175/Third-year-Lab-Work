    "\n",
    "Imagine a company uses drones to deliver packages in a city. Each drone is equipped with sensors to detect obstacles, GPS for navigation, cameras for visual input and an onboard AI system to decide the best route, avoid collisions and adjust to weather conditions. It can recharge itself when low on battery and notify the control center if it faces a failure. Identify the type of agent used in the above scenario. Draw a suitable agent component diagram and comment on the agent type and its suitability.\n",
